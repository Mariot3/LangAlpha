"""Folding an account's other flash rows into the Home its id derives.

A flash row's id derives from the user id it was made for, so a row only stops
matching its owner when it changes accounts: an account merge moves an
account's rows onto the account it joins, its flash row included, under an id
derived from the merged account. The account would then list two "All
workspaces" entries, one holding the merged account's conversations. The fold
moves what that row holds into Home and retires it, so the history reads as
one.

Only a never-bound row folds: a bound one owns a folder on its computer, which
moving rows cannot carry. A row with a run in progress waits for a later
resolve, by the busy rule a delete uses. Nothing in the workspace memory tier
moves, because an unbound row's agent never had one.
